This is my React project am focused on try to build Day-Roll or to-do list app.

## To-Do

I want to add the task indicator if it is already be done or not yet.

## Issues to fix

I discovered there are a lot of things needed to make this app quick use

1. Stop "Enter key" to auto reload the page
2. Register "Enter key" to collect the data together with the add button(+)
3. Change time displayed in the user interface (instead of 12:00 => 12:00AM or 24hrs if possible)
4. Return the autofocus on Write a Roll input.
5. Create a user alert⚠️ to help the user know what happening
   -if he / she doesn't fulfill all input fields
   -to check the input field
